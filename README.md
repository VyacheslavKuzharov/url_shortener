## ABOUT  URL SHORTENER

A URL shortener is an online application that converts a regular URL (the web address that starts with http or https)
into its condensed format.

## SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE AND ARCHITECTURE

Using AngularJS, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

### Basic NodeJS plugins currently in use:

* app-root-dir (Simple module to infer the root directory of the currently running node application)
* body-parser (Node.js body parsing middleware)
* express (Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js)
* mongoose (Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment)
* pug (A clean, whitespace-sensitive template language for writing HTML)

### Basic AngularJS plugins currently in use:

* angular-ui-bootstrap (UI Bootstrap - AngularJS directives specific to Bootstrap)
* angular-ui-router (State-based routing for AngularJS)

* Bootstrap (The most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web)

## USER DIALOGS AND CONTROL FLOW

The user only has to copy the full URL of a website and paste it into the URL shortening tool to come up with an abbreviated
version that is around 8 to 10 characters long.
At a high level the URL shortener works by taking a long URL and applying a hashing algorithm to spit out a shorter version of the URL
and stores them in a database for later lookup.

## DATABASE MODEL

MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program.
Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemas.
In Url Shortener we use MongoDB for store original and short url pair.
